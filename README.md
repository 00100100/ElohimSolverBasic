ElohimSolverBasic
=================

Solves Sigils of Elohim using backtracking. No pruning (Very slow)

This program will take a pool of pieces and jam them in every which way possible into the board. Unfortunately, this is
very, very slow. Some partial solutions are bad and shouldn't be investigated further. This program will continue to
investigate bad partial solutions.

Take this and add your own pruning methods, special pieces, special board, or whatnot.
